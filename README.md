  ## Description
  This node app demonstrates my understanding of the MVC framework and my proficiency in all languages and packages used. Using a MySQL database with the mysql2, express-sequelize, express-handlebars, express-session, and bcrypt packages, I've developed a fully functional web application which allows users to sign up, log in, view and create blog posts, as well as interact with posts by commenting on them. Users may also choose to update or delete their posts.

  ## Installation
  No installation required, simply visit the deployed app here [https://guarded-harbor-81763.herokuapp.com/]

  ## Usage
  Upon landing on the homepage, you will see any posts that have been created, including their title, author, and the date they were created. You are able to click on the titles of any of these posts to view that posts page and any comments it has. However, you won't be able to comment on any posts until you've logged in! If it's your first time you can click on the "login" nav link at the top of the page, and navigate to the sign up form via the link at the bottom of the login form. Once you've signed up you will automatically be logged in and sent to your dashboard where you can create new posts of your own, or click on your existing posts to either edit or delete them. Now that you're logged in you will also be able to navigate to any post from the homepage and leave a comment!
